            We need to prove that a \& b $\implies$ c, a \& c $\implies$ b, and b \& c $\implies$ a\\

            Statement b) is equivalent to $edges\geq n-1$\\
            We prove this through induction.  Base case $n=2$, $edges\geq1$\\
            Assume: with n nodes $edges\geq n-1$\\
            Prove: with $n+1$ nodes $edges\geq n$\\
            Suppose that graph G has n nodes and $n-1$ edges.  Graph G' is identical to G but with
            one more vertex than G.  In order to make G identical to G' we need to add one vertex and
            to connect it, 1 edge.

            Statement c) is equivalent to $edges\leq n-1$\\
            This is also proven through induction
            Base case $n=2$, $edges\leq1$\\
            Assume: with n nodes $edges\leq n-1$\\
            Prove: with $n+1$ nodes $edges\leq n$\\
            Suppose that graph G has n nodes and $n-1$ edges.  Graph G' is identical but with n edges
            We can only make G and G' identical by deleting an edge from G'.  G' has a cycle because all
            n edges connect n nodes with 1 edge left over.  This edge makes a cycle.
            \item \\ a) \\
            \item \\
            $F(n+2) = F(n+1) + F(n)$\\
            $F(n+1) = F(n) + F(n-1)$\\
            \vdots\\
            $F(2) = F(1) + F(0)$\\
            $F(1) = F(0) + 1$\\
            \item \\
            \item \\ Reduce Hamiltonian path to BDST\\
                1) Given a graph G with vertices U and V. Create a Graph M by attaching new nodes P & Q respectively to U and V.\\
                2) Let k represent the max number of edges and let k = 2. BDST(M,K=2) forces the spanning tree to be a path. Connect P $&$ Q to force the path to start and end with U and V. We reduced the hamiltonian path to BDST. The hamiltonian path, therefore isn't polynomial, and implies that BDST isn't polynomial either.
